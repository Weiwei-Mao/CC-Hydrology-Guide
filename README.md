**A Practical Guide to Claude Code for Hydrological Research** *(maybe applicable to environmental and related fields)*

A practical guide based on personal usage experience, covering common hydrological research scenarios including data analysis, visualization, literature management, hydrological modeling, presentation preparation, and more. *Note: This is not a comprehensive guide—just a collection of practical tips from one researcher's journey.*

## Introduction

This project is a **personal collection** of Claude Code usage tips based on my own research experience in hydrology (maybe applicable to environmental and related fields). Claude Code is [Anthropic's official AI command-line assistant](https://claude.com/claude-code) that can help you work more efficiently with data analysis, code writing, literature management, and more.

> **Disclaimer**: This guide reflects my personal experience and is by no means exhaustive. Hydrology is a vast field—this just covers the scenarios I've encountered in my research. Feel free to adapt and extend these examples for your own needs.

### Target Audience

- Researchers and graduate students in hydrology, environmental science, and related fields
- Anyone who needs to process hydrological/environmental data and perform statistical analysis
- Researchers looking to leverage AI to improve research efficiency

### What You'll Learn

- How to use Claude Code with natural language to complete tasks
- How to efficiently process hydrological time series data
- How to quickly generate scientific visualization charts
- How to manage literature and assist with paper writing
